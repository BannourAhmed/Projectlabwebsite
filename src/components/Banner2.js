                  <p>A central goal of the course is to familiarize students with writing effective, journal-style research
papers. Papers are a key way in which scientists share research findings and learn about othersâ€™
work.
</p>
                  <p>A good paper requires writing precisely and correctly as well as anticipating readersâ€™ needs. When
students are deeply focused on the details of their research, it can be hard for them to imagine what
the reading experience may be like for someone new to that research.

                  <p>Researchers (both in academia and industry)Â constantly collaborate with each other, so the course is
structured to give students a taste of not only research but also research collaboration.<p>
Each team works differently. Often, each student takes on a different part of the work. For example,
one student may enjoy reviewing the literature or developing a theory while another plays with the
data or creates a computer simulation. We support this technique since it mimics the productive
teamwork of professional researchers.</p>
<p>Favorably, students can do more as a group than they might on their own. To get over obstacles,
they can support one another, learn from one another, attempt a variety of strategies, and rely on
one another&#39;s complementing abilities and interests. They can inspire one another and share ideas.
Because writers are frequently too close to their own work to recognize errors, teammates can
provide each other with useful critiques.</p>
Teamwork can be difficult! We genuinely want students to struggle a little with teamwork, make
deliberate choices about how to deal with their problems, and through that process, become better
prepared for teamwork in the future.<p>
All team members are required to contribute equally. In exceptional cases, if a conflict is reported to
the responsible instructor, the team might be broken apart.</p>
Focusing on the team&#39;s project is likely the most useful tactic when there are problems with
teamwork. Focusing on the objective can frequently make the teamwork issue appear less
significant.</p></ShowMoreText>
